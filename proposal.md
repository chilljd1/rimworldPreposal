# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A choose your adventure game with a good or bad ending

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I am going to make a visual novel that allows you to choose how you want to progress to reach the end. Using your choices you will decide if you want to progress going with a passive run or if you want to be more evil when interacting with other people or creatures. These choices will lead you down different paths and will effect how you end the game. I want to create the game using Ren'Py or Twine. 
 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will create the beginning of the story and make characters with some interaction/dialog options

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can get the story progressed pretty close to the end 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I can make the whole game with decent graphics and a good story with interesting characters and creatures. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

My next step is to learn how to navigate and use websites like ren'PY and twine. I want to learn how to create visual novels using them and make my game look good. I will research topics about choice making games.
